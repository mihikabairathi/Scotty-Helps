What does it take, technically, to achieve net zero and what else, beyond technical requirements, advances or impedes a net zero future? 48-752 is a graduate level class that explores net zero energy design and construction in the residential sector. Through case studies and applied projects, we will explore what it takes to achieve quantitative net zero in residential buildings while maintaining occupant comfort and satisfaction. In locations where net zero is now required, we will examine the results of those requirements. At the outset, we will discuss specific definitions of a net-zero building and the implications of each definition. Through case studies, lectures, field trips, outside reading and assignments, we will examine how a net-zero building is achieved, including the use of renewable energy to achieve the net-zero balance. We will apply lessons learned from metered examples to real sites and to new design or renovation projects in Pittsburgh and will use simulation software to test and quantify the impact of our design/renovation strategies. We will also compare our strategies to requirements in US codes and rating systems such as IECC-2012 and LEED for Homes to evaluate their impact in moving the US residential sector toward much higher performance buildings. Although our focus is residential, many of the concepts and strategies we cover have parallels in the commercial sector.

Recognizing that most businesses are subject to high levels of variability, risk and uncertainty, it will adopt a stochastic approach to characterize the behavior of business systems and processes, and explore the effects of alternative decisions in this context.  Two modeling methodologies will be covered: (i) stochastic modeling, and (ii) stochastic simulation. Examples are drawn from different managerial domains, such as supply chain management, risk management, marketing, and project management. The lectures, homework assignments, exam and term project will focus on modeling, computational, and analytical skills. Computational implementations will be done in Excel using the @Risk add-in (during the first half of the course to build simple simulation models) and the Arena software (during the second half of the course to build more complex models based on discrete-event simulation).   Course objectives: 1. Recognize uncertainty in business systems and processes, and their impact on managerial decisions (e.g., demand uncertainty, financial risk, etc.)  2. Model uncertainty and risk quantitatively using probabilistic tools 3. Specify probabilistic distributions for inputs from available data 4. Generate probabilistic distributions for outputs and relevant performance metrics (e.g., average, standard deviation, distribution tails)  5. Develop computational models to simulate complex stochastic processes using appropriate software 6.

Starting around 1900, photography was practiced with two dominant strands.  One of these firmly believed in the power of photographs to provide a window on the world, and was led by Lewis Hine, whose documentary photographs for the National Child Labor Committee helped to ameliorate living and working conditions for thousands of immigrant children.  The other strand adhered to the philosophy of Alfred Stieglitz who adamantly affirmed that photographs were first and foremost reflections of the soul and were art objects, equal to painting, drawing and sculpture.  These two schools of thought guided photographers throughout the twentieth century.   This course explores in depth the tremendous range of photographic expression since World War II and examines in particular the contributions of significant image-makers such as Helen Levitt, W.

But inequality strikes us an especially timely topic because of the current demands for greater political, social, and economic equality. The four of us will use the disciplines we come from - economics, anthropology, history, psychology, and literary/cultural studies - to introduce you to the concept of inequality in the age of capitalism. We will consider how inequality emerged as a social and political problem in the 18th and 19th centuries, and how it has re-emerged as a key concept for socio-political movements in our current moment.

Illustrative examples will be drawn from the area of semiconductor nanostructures, including their applications in novel and next-generation electronic, photonic, and sensing devices.  The course begins with a review of basic concepts in quantum physics (wave-particle duality, Schrdingers equation, particle-in-a-box, approximation methods in quantum mechanics, etc.) and then continues with a discussion of bulk three-dimensional solids (band structure, density of states, the single-electron effective-mass approximation). Size effects due to nanometer-scale spatial localization are then discussed within a quantum-confinement model in one-, two-, and three- dimensions for electrons. An analogous discussion for photons is also presented. The basic electronic, optical, and mechanical properties of the low-dimensional nanostructures are then discussed. A select number of applications in electronics, photonics, biology, chemistry, and bio-engineering will be discussed to illustrate the range of utility of nanostructures. Upon completion of the course, students will have an appreciation and an understanding of some of the fundamental concepts in nanoscience and   nanotechnology.

We will examine how writers unpack problems rhetorically and use evidence to argue solutions for different stakeholders who may not share common values.

What is less well-known is that a major factor contributing to this wage gap is that women are simply less likely to ask for a raise or negotiate for a high starting salary. However, the solution is not as simple as telling women to ask for raises: recent research also shows that (unlike men) when women do ask for more money, they are perceived as unlikeable and difficult. This course will look at how gender-based stereotypes affect how we perceive and respond to different communication acts. The exact same sentencespoken with the exact same body language and intonationcan often elicit different reactions depending on whether the speaker is a man or a woman. Such stereotypes harm and limit both men and women. Just as a woman asking for a raise may be perceived as pushy or difficult, a man trying to console a male friend is often perceived as weak and unlikeable. This course will identify some of these stereotypes and then look at research suggesting what steps we can take to minimize their impact. For instance, we will examine how companies can take steps to minimize gender bias in written employee performance evaluations. We will examine strategies women can use to ask for a raise without being perceived negatively. We will develop strategies for responding to biased language and perceptions.

In this introduction to the interdisciplinary study of literacyits history, theory, and problemswe will first explore competing theories of what literacy allows you to do, how people learn to carry off different literate practices, and what schools should teach. Then we will turn ideas into action in a hands-on, community literacy project, helping urban students use writing to take literate action for themselves. As mentors, we meet on campus for 8 weeks with teenagers from Pittsburghs inner city neighborhoods who are working on the challenging transition from school to work. They earn the opportunity to come to CMU as part of Start On Success (SOS), an innovative internship that helps urban teenagers with hidden learning disabilities negotiate the new demands of work or college. We mentor them through Decision Makers (a CMU computer-supported learning project that uses writing as a tool for reflective decision making.)

The course broadly examines the fraught relationship between rhetoric and law by considering the ways in which a variety of legal discourses serve to construct and reinforce identities, with a particular focus on the ways in which legal systems are portrayed to reflect the ideals of democracy to suit particular foreign relations goals. We begin by studying the ways in which Cold War foreign policy goals influenced desegregation and civil rights discourse in the United States, then we turn to the ways in which the prosecutions of deposed authoritarian rulers in various regions of the globe have been orchestrated to persuade global audiences that emerging democracies observe the rule of law for purposes of garnering international support. Alongside primary sources of legal discourse, we will study a selection of interdisciplinary scholarship about the relationship between rhetoric and law.

The exact same sentencespoken with the exact same body language and intonationcan often elicit different reactions depending on whether the speaker is a man or a woman. Such stereotypes harm and limit both men and women. Just as a woman asking for a raise may be perceived as pushy or difficult, a man trying to console a male friend is often perceived as weak and unlikeable. This course will identify some of these stereotypes and then look at research suggesting what steps we can take to minimize their impact.

Ever since, historians have struggled to explain why fears of witchcraft suddenly became so acute in this period.

The course is oriented around developing answers to three key questions: (1) How should managers of technology firms evaluate potential strategies or projects when the outcome of innovation is uncertain? To address this question, the course introduces cost-benefit models for determining project value and how to use these models to make managerial decisions. (2) How do market characteristics shape the optimal pricing decisions of the firm?

FALL 2019: Venezuela y Colombia: War, Peace, Migration and Exile Venezuela and Colombia converge around many elements, from a common colonial past to shared geographical regions and cultural customs. However, their societies, politics, and cultural production often have followed divergent paths, leading to a current juncture characterized by both fraternity and adversity.  Many of these differences stem from societal and cultural transformations developed during the twentieth century. Over the past few decades, for instance, Colombians have gone from emigrating to Venezuela in search of a peaceful and prosperous future, to hosting thousands of Venezuelan refugees fleeing current economic and political conditions.

In contrast, the differences between Mozart and Mahler simply represent different stages within a single evolutionary development.    Guided by readings from music theory and historical musicology, as well as by our own analyses of scores, this course will attempt to chart these developments across three musical styles that overlap both in time and in substance: the baroque, the galant, and the classical.

In this course, the theorems are not just formulated but actually proved.

With this basis, one can show that syntactic notions concerning set theory are representable in the very theory.  It is then easy to prove that set theory is incomplete.  To show that logic is undecidable, the crucial concept of computation is introduced via Turing machines. The two concepts - proof and computation - are fundamental for mathematics, computer science and, in particular, artificial intelligence.   The undecidability and incompleteness results are among the most significant contributions of modern logic to the foundations of mathematics.

The proofs of these results require a novel metamathematical perspective, but also striking logical concepts and fascinating mathematical techniques. In this course, the theorems are not just formulated but actually proved.   We begin with the axiomatic development of elementary set theory that allows, at the same time, the formal representation of informal mathematics like number theory.  With this basis, one can show that syntactic notions concerning set theory are representable in the very theory.  It is then easy to prove that set theory is incomplete.  To show that logic is undecidable, the crucial concept of computation is introduced via Turing machines. The two concepts - proof and computation - are fundamental for mathematics, computer science and, in particular, artificial intelligence.   The undecidability and incompleteness results are among the most significant contributions of modern logic to the foundations of mathematics.

After taking the course, students should be able to name examples of such situations for which they can provide a coherent line of reasoning that outlines these connections.

The curriculum of 90-745 has been rewritten to help Heinz students (and other interested CMU students) think seriously and rigorously about the future of work in the 21st century American economy.  Drawing upon the most recent quantitative analyses, the course will show that technological change has contributed to increasingly unequal outcomes in the U.S. labor market for decades, and that this trend is likely to continue as a new wave of technological change unfolds.  The course will also consider the degree to which globalization, immigration, rising monopoly power, declining union strength, minimum wage laws, and discrimination based on race and gender have contributed to rising inequality in U.S. incomes.  The course will draw upon frontier research to identify old and new policy ideas that could help make economic growth more inclusive, and it will bring into the classroom policy entrepreneurs who are making a real difference.

Program evaluations differ as much as the social programs they evaluate. Social programs may carry them out internally, or an external organization may be brought in. An evaluation may be highly quantitative or entirely qualitative; it may focus exclusively on needs assessment or assessing program implementation. Evaluations and their results may be highly politically charged or of interest only to direct stakeholders. There are excellent program evaluations that have had tremendous positive impacts on programs and their target populations. There are also poor or flawed program evaluations that provide weaker information than could have been obtained, provide incorrect information, or are misleading.

While we will cover standard economic approaches, we will give extra attention to how a behavioral lens can help in both understanding development issues (e.g. barriers to household risk management) and in designing effective interventions (e.g. the timing of fertilizer sales).", "prereqs": null, "prereqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}, "coreqs": null, "coreqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}, "name": "Behavioral Economics of Poverty and Development", "units": 12.0, "department": "Public Policy & Mgt:Sch of Pub Pol & Mgt", "lectures": [{"times": [{"days": [2, 4], "begin": "01:30PM", "end": "02:50PM", "building": "BH", "room": "237B", "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"}], "name": "A", "instructors": ["Haggag, Kareem"]}], "sections": []}, "90-891": {"desc": "Behavioral Economics is a sub-field of economics that, relying on insights from psychology and decision-making, aspires to describe actual behavior with greater empirical accuracy and psychological realism than that implied by the standard neoclassical model.

We will first document and review the underlying theory for three conceptual departures from the standard model -non-standard preferences (e.g., present-bias, reference dependence), non-standard beliefs (e.g., overconfidence, gamblers fallacy), and non-standard decision-making (e.g., heuristics, emotions, framing effects)-and then quickly move to assess the evidence for these claims in field settings. We will additionally explore how markets respond to behavioral biases, and discuss recent research in behavioral policy with an emphasis on policies aimed at increasing savings, improving food choice, and heightening program take-up and compliance. The course will be paper-centric and we will review a variety of popular empirical methods from field experiments to quasi-experimental approaches (e.g., estimation through regression-based panel analyses, difference-in-differences, and instrumental variables).

In the first few months of the project (January to April), students conduct user research and brainstorm product ideas. The user research phase begins with students conducting contextual inquiries and background research to understand the nature and needs of the customer/user and tasks relevant to their problem. Based on that understanding, students go through an innovation phase producing product ideas situated to meet the identified needs. With strong sponsor input, they narrow down their ideas and select one or more to pursue further. Then, over the summer, students engage in a prototyping and user-testing phase where they produce prototypes with increasing fidelity and iteratively test them with users to improve the design.

Practicum Syllabus: Societal Computing Topics Literature review. Write a literature review, working with advisor to pick topic and identify research questions. Writing includes critiquing papers being synthesized in the review. This is intended to be a short form literature review of approximately 2-4 pages, of the sort that typically introduces a conference paper. What makes good interdisciplinary research?

They are difficult to visualize, and it is difficult to understand what sort of errors and biases are present in them. They are computationally expensive to process, and often the cost of learning is hard to predict - for instance, and algorithm that runs quickly in a dataset that fits in memory may be exorbitantly expensive when the dataset is too large for memory. Large datasets may also display qualitatively different behavior in terms of which learning methods produce the most accurate predictions.  This course is intended to provide a student practical knowledge of, and experience with, the issues involving large datasets. Among the issues considered are: scalable learning techniques, such as streaming machine learning techniques; parallel infrastructures such as map-reduce; practical techniques for reducing the memory requirements for learning methods, such as feature hashing and Bloom filters; and techniques for analysis of programs in terms of memory, disk usage, and (for parallel methods) communication complexity.

It should be of interest to anyone wishing to see the  way statistical ideas play out within the brain sciences, and it  will provide a series of case studies on the role of stochastic  models in scientific investigation.  Statistical ideas have been part of neurophysiology and the brainsciences since the first stochastic description of spike trains, and the quantal hypothesis of neurotransmitter release, more than 50 years ago. Many contemporary theories of neural system behavior are built  with statistical models. For example, integrate-and-fire neurons are  usually assumed to be driven in part by stochastic noise; the role of  spike timing involves the distinction between Poisson and non-Poisson  neurons; and oscillations are characterized by decomposing variation  into frequency-based components.  In the visual system, V1 simple  cells are often described using linear-nonlinear Poisson models; in  the motor system, neural response may involve direction tuning; and  CA1 hippocampal receptive field plasticity has been characterized  using dynamic place models.  It has also been proposed that  perceptions, decisions, and actions result from optimal (Bayesian)  combination of sensory input with previously-learned regularities; and  some investigators report new insights from viewing whole-brain  pattern responses as analogous to statistical classifiers.  Throughout the field of statistics, models incorporating random ``noise components are used as an effective vehicle for data analysis.

Bank lending, interest on bank loans, the M2 money stock, and the interbank interest rate are explored in terms of the model.  A stylized history of financial intermediation explains the coexistence of banking, bond finance, and equity finance.

We see why higher minimum equity capital requirements for banks are the best regulatory means of maintaining a healthy and stable financial system.  We identify the intended and unintended consequences for banking stability of central bank last resort lending. Actual Federal Reserve monetary and credit policies in the financial crisis are evaluated using the model.

And we review actual Federal Reserve decision-making in detail since 1979 covering the Volcker disinflation and the Greenspan era.       We assess current macroeconomic stabilization problems involving i) politics, banking, and exchange rate policies in China, ii) the European Central Bank, banking, and fiscal policy in the Euro area, iii) capital inflows, exchange rate and inflation stabilization in emerging market economies and, iv) safe-haven capital inflows into Switzerland.

Determining the price of a product or service is one of the most important marketing decisions. It is also one of the most complex and least understood aspects of marketing.

In todays hypercompetitive environment, even slight errors in determining the best price can lead to large financial losses. This course draws on the fundamental disciplines of microeconomics, statistics and psychology to shed light on good pricing practice. It surveys some popular pricing practices, explores their pitfalls, and identifies the fallacies they are based on. The first part of the course discusses the foundations for sound pricing decisions: costs, customer and competition. It then moves on to current pricing strategies, tactics and their applications: pricing over the product life cycle; product line pricing; pricing through the marketing channel; price discrimination; two-part tariffs and nonlinear pricing; price bundling; perceived value pricing; and competitive pricing. The course objectives are (1) to build the right pricing philosophy that guides everyday marketing activities, (2) to introduce a framework, based on concepts drawn from cognitive psychology, economics and industrial organization, to study pricing decisions, and (3) to master some concrete analytical and numerical tools for its successful creation, utilization, and management of sound pricing decisions", "prereqs": null, "prereqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}, "coreqs": null, "coreqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}, "name": "Pricing Strategy", "units": 6.0, "department": "Tepper School of Business", "lectures": [{"times": [{"days": [1, 3], "begin": "03:30PM", "end": "05:15PM", "building": "TEP", "room": "2112", "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"}], "name": "A4", "instructors": ["Boatwright, Peter"]}, {"times": [{"days": [1, 3], "begin": "10:30AM", "end": "12:15PM", "building": "TEP", "room": "2119", "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"}], "name": "B4", "instructors": ["Boatwright, Peter"]}], "sections": []}, "45-830": {"desc": "This course is aimed at the manager who is the ultimate user of marketing research and the one responsible for determining the scope and direction of research activities.

Examples of technology-intensive industries are computer hardware and software, media and entertainment, telecommunications and e-commerce. Students explore the unique economic circumstances facing firms in these industries and identify strategies that enable firms to succeed given these circumstances. This course is ideal for students who want to pursue a career as a product/product line manager for a technology company.     This course helps students understand the unique economic characteristics seen in todays technology-intensive markets and how they impact the strategic interactions among firms and consumers. Students study, for example: Why firms in technology markets give away their best products for free. Why Apple taxes consumers for hardware but subsidizes music, movies, etc. while Amazon subsidizes their hardware but tax software (music, books, movies, etc). Why Sony won the Blu-Ray format war against HD-DVD which was sponsored by a whole array of companies. In order for students to understand how firms strategically interact in technology-intensive industries this course will use a combination of simple but rigorous analytical models, emerging theories, and formal case studies.", "prereqs": null, "prereqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}, "coreqs": null, "coreqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}, "name": "Technology Strategy", "units": 6.0, "department": "Tepper School of Business", "lectures": [{"times": [{"days": [2, 4], "begin": "10:30AM", "end": "12:15PM", "building": "TEP", "room": "2111", "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"}], "name": "A4", "instructors": ["Derdenger, Tim"]}, {"times": [{"days": [2, 4], "begin": "03:30PM", "end": "05:15PM", "building": "TEP", "room": "2111", "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"}], "name": "B4", "instructors": ["Derdenger, Tim"]}, {"times": [{"days": [1], "begin": "06:30PM", "end": "10:00PM", "building": "TEP", "room": "2111", "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"}], "name": "E4", "instructors": ["Derdenger, Tim"]}], "sections": []}, "45-832": {"desc": "This course covers why brands are important, what they represent to consumers, how companies currently manage their brands, and strategies for creating and sustaining brand equity.", "prereqs": null, "prereqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}, "coreqs": null, "coreqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}, "name": "Brand Strategy", "units": 6.0, "department": "Tepper School of Business", "lectures": [{"times": [{"days": [1, 3], "begin": "01:30PM", "end": "03:15PM", "building": "TEP", "room": "2112", "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"}], "name": "A3", "instructors": ["Corder, Lloyd"]}], "sections": []}, "45-822": {"desc": "Corporate Finance (45-822) is a case-based elective course that covers topics in capital budgeting, corporate valuation, payout policy, capital structure, and real options.

This approach assumes that managers use all the available information when making decisions.  It is thus particularly useful when managing projects that involve dynamic and state-contingent choices among alternatives (options), especially of a strategic nature.  Examples include investing in and developing new products or technology, expanding/reducing manufacturing capacity, and suspending/resuming production. The valuation of financial options is the conceptual basis of real options management (but this course does not assume prior knowledge of this topic).  Real options analysis extends this fundamental market-driven valuation approach to a much broader spectrum of business applications that feature dynamic decision making.  It thus contrasts the standard net present value rule used by static discounted cash flow analysis.  The resulting managerial decisions and asset valuations can be very different when real options analysis is used rather than static discounted cash flow analysis. A unique feature of this course is blending market-based valuation and decision making concepts and techniques within business analytics.
