1,"The 48-105 studio, called Foundation II, is the second studio in CMU?s professional B.Arch program.  It builds on the lessons from 48-100 about clear architectural communication and abstract spatial-definition, but adds a greater emphasis on the material and experiential understanding of how architecture is made and used.  We continue to emphasize architectural drawing and models (both analog and digital) as the primary means of architectural communication, but also as a method of creatively exploring and rigorously testing fundamental architectural ideas.  We investigate, research, analyze, diagram, and apply lessons from local architecture, and great architecture of the past, in studio, and in the parallel survey of architectural history.   We introduce the use of ?systems,? ?computational thinking,? and ?rules? in the design process to create order, deal with a range of parameters, and satisfy specific performance criteria.  Beginning with more abstract formal design exercises, and ending with the design of a small building, we explore how tectonics, joinery, materials, as well as site, orientation, context, and human use can be harnessed to inspire great design.  The design process is still carefully controlled, but students are encouraged to begin to speculate and take careful risks.",48-100,62-123,Architecture Design Studio: Foundation II,15.0,Architecture,"Damiani, Gerard",Freshman,48-105,24.07,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.13,4.0,4.47

This architectural history seminar will study in roughly chronological order some of the major theories and theoreticians of architecture from Vitruvius through the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, the 19th-century, up to the modern era. Throughout the seminar we will chart the changing definitions of what constitutes theory in architecture, and how it relates to other writings such as criticism and history. Well study in-depth how (if at all) theory relates to the intellectual context and built works before and after the writings. Students will discover how ideas on topics such as structure, expression, sustainability, form, and materials reoccur, and even the oldest theories have contemporary relevance.

3,"The basis for the CMU studio course sequence is the expectation that the student retains and applies knowledge gained each semester to the current studio. The spring semester of the third year of architectural studies at Carnegie Mellon University is concerned with the detailed development and refinement of an architectural design as informed by the technical knowledge of structural systems, enclosure systems and the process of construction. The student is expected to articulate concepts and develop designs with more precision and in greater detail than done in previous studios and courses. In addition to criteria related to the development of design skills appropriate to ones sixth semester of the studio sequence, the following criteria are an explicit part of the evaluation of the student work: Aesthetics: The degree to which the design responds to formal issues as articulated in prior design studios. Structural System: The degree to which the proposed building is presented as a statically stable structure which defines the spatial order and satisfies the architectural intentions made explicit in the project. Enclosure System: The degree to which the proposed enclosure system satisfies the design requirements and responds to the physical phenomena of the environment into which it is placed. Material Selection: The degree to which the selected building materials and their implementation are appropriate to the occupancy, articulate the architectural order, and satisfy the physical design requirements. Constructability: The degree to which the proposed building is developed in response to an understanding of the processes of construction.

In locations where net zero is now required, we will examine the results of those requirements. At the outset, we will discuss specific definitions of a net-zero building and the implications of each definition. Through case studies, lectures, field trips, outside reading and assignments, we will examine how a net-zero building is achieved, including the use of renewable energy to achieve the net-zero balance.

304,"Most photographs tell stories. We see photographs in newspapers, magazines, snapshot albums, on the web, in books, and in posters. In these contexts photographs often work with words to convey meaning, whether they are shown with captions, news stories, or just with titles.

In addition to making photographs, students will determine the context in which their photo-stories will be seen. Students may make photo books, for example, or decide that their images will be seen on a website.  While students are making photographs, we will explore the rich traditions of photo-graphic story-telling that range from the world-oriented work of photo-journalist W.

307,"Invented in 1839, photography was a form of visual expression that immediately attracted a large public following. Starting around 1900, photography was practiced with two dominant strands.  One of these firmly believed in the power of photographs to provide a window on the world, and was led by Lewis Hine, whose documentary photographs for the National Child Labor Committee helped to ameliorate living and working conditions for thousands of immigrant children.  The other strand adhered to the philosophy of Alfred Stieglitz who adamantly affirmed that photographs were first and foremost reflections of the soul and were art objects, equal to painting, drawing and sculpture.  These two schools of thought guided photographers throughout the twentieth century.   This course explores in depth the tremendous range of photographic expression since World War II and examines in particular the contributions of significant image-makers such as Helen Levitt, W. Eugene Smith, Robert Frank, Diane Arbus, Garry Winogrand, Charles Teenie Harris, Cindy Sherman, Carrie Mae Weems, Nan Goldin, James Nachtwey, and many others.

Income inequality has reached such a peak that eight men own as much wealth as half the worlds population, the worlds poorest 3.6 billion people.

Patents and other technology rights are increasingly valuable to businesses, and are no longer limited to large manufacturing or scientific companies. Start-ups and mid-sized firms in numerous industries use technology rights to increase their return on innovation and innovative activity. When used effectively, these legal tools can lead to significant and sometimes surprising business advantages. Patent rights can enable small companies to prevent copying by competitors, earn higher revenue from licensing technology, and compete more effectively against much larger firms. Knowledge of technology rights can provide a powerful competitive advantage and provide many nonintuitive  opportunities. In addition, these legal mechanisms can be made even more effective if they are integrated with the organizations innovation processes: the way that organizations manage the conception, development, and production of new products, services, technologies, and business models. This is in contrast to the more common practice of treating innovation and patenting as distinct and consecutive processes.

1027,"This course provides students with the tools to understand patents and technology rights, and how these assets can be utilized in a firms innovation processes. Patents and other technology rights are increasingly valuable to businesses, and are no longer limited to large manufacturing or scientific companies. Start-ups and mid-sized firms in numerous industries use technology rights to increase their return on innovation and innovative activity. When used effectively, these legal tools can lead to significant and sometimes surprising business advantages. Patent rights can enable small companies to prevent copying by competitors, earn higher revenue from licensing technology, and compete more effectively against much larger firms. Knowledge of technology rights can provide a powerful competitive advantage and provide many nonintuitive  opportunities. In addition, these legal mechanisms can be made even more effective if they are integrated with the organizations innovation processes: the way that organizations manage the conception, development, and production of new products, services, technologies, and business models. This is in contrast to the more common practice of treating innovation and patenting as distinct and consecutive processes. Highly innovative organizations develop new products and technologies guided in part by the patents and other technology rights that can eventually enhance value. This course is believed to be unique in its focus on the complete innovation life cycle. It treats intangible assets like patents and business strategies as part of the process of developing innovations.

Instead, this section provides a fascinating look at how numbers and words intersect to create persuasive arguments in academic, professional, and popular contexts.

More technically, well be focusing on the rhetorical nature of intertextual discourse. Our goal will be to examine the ways that people of all kindsincluding politicians, journalists, and scientistsstrategically draw upon and transform the statements, arguments, and evidence of other people to promote their own viewpoints or purposes. We will begin by investigating scholarship that views language as an extended conversation in which people struggle to have their own voices heard, and other voices countered or even suppressed. Later, we will survey a number of studies that suggest how individuals and organizations recontextualize and reinterpret prior discourse for persuasive ends.  More specifically, we will analyze how the micro-features of the language (for example, qualifications, evaluations, and attributions) are used to persuade audiences that certain assertions are (not) factual, that certain speakers are (not) authoritative, and that certain proposed actions are (un)desirable.

Globalization is a political, economic, and cultural phenomenon that deeply impacts how well we can communicate with others in both professional and interpersonal settings. Regardless of the language people speak and the cultures that may have shaped our beliefs and values, we are bound together by professional interests and political agendas in a community that has no choice but to function well. In the current international environment, some of the most important and rewarding employment opportunities are with multinational and international corporations. But are we prepared for the challenge of working with professionals from all over the world? Even as more people around the globe learn English, specific cultural values, beliefs, and assumptions continue to influence the way in which they communicate. More often than not there is a whole different worldview behind a foreign accent. Globalization brings along several pressing questions:  How can professional communicators avoid the potential for misunderstanding and conflict that comes with cultural difference? How can professional communicators contribute to shaping a workplace discourse that can reach a wide, diverse, global audience? How can professional global communication be effectively planned, measured, and improved?

1091,"It is well-known that there is a gender wage gap in the United States: on average, a woman performing the exact same work as a male colleague will make 78-82 of his salary. What is less well-known is that a major factor contributing to this wage gap is that women are simply less likely to ask for a raise or negotiate for a high starting salary. However, the solution is not as simple as telling women to ask for raises: recent research also shows that (unlike men) when women do ask for more money, they are perceived as unlikeable and difficult. This course will look at how gender-based stereotypes affect how we perceive and respond to different communication acts. The exact same sentencespoken with the exact same body language and intonationcan often elicit different reactions depending on whether the speaker is a man or a woman. Such stereotypes harm and limit both men and women. Just as a woman asking for a raise may be perceived as pushy or difficult, a man trying to console a male friend is often perceived as weak and unlikeable. This course will identify some of these stereotypes and then look at research suggesting what steps we can take to minimize their impact. For instance, we will examine how companies can take steps to minimize gender bias in written employee performance evaluations. We will examine strategies women can use to ask for a raise without being perceived negatively. We will develop strategies for responding to biased language and perceptions.

They read off of notes, speak too fast, or pepper their speech with nervous filler words such as um or you know.  If this describes you, consider taking Oral Communication. This class is intended for students who want to boost their confidence in presenting in front of others. You will learn strategies for structuring the content of a presentation, designing effective presentation slides, and controlling your voice and body language to produce a smooth, confident-sounding oral delivery. You will also learn communication strategies to help you in interviews and other less formal communication situations. We will begin with giving short informal presentations and gradually increase the stakes as your confidence improves. You will have weekly opportunities to practice and improve your skills. We will also find opportunities to practice in a variety of physical settings so you can envision yourself as a calm, confident speaker no matter your surroundings.

Students can expect to read and discuss narrative theories and practice employing these theories to analyze story artifacts, such as written collections, political speeches, newspaper articles, curated experiences, and oral histories. We will begin the semester by exploring and analyzing the many stories surrounding September 11 but will also consider the stories that infuse recent or local subjects of interest. Students will investigate the effect these and other narratives have on contemporary contexts. Any student who is interested in developing a critical awareness of the rhetorical power of storytelling and enhancing their analytical toolkit will benefit from this course.  Most class sessions will involve guided student discussions of theoretical texts as well as collaborative opportunities to analyze story artifacts.

1112,"Understanding reading and writing as a social/cognitive process  (i.e., a socially situated thinking, feeling, problem-solving process) reveals some of the conscious and unconscious work behind the ways readers comprehend and interpret texts, and the ways writers construct and communicate meanings through them.  To gain insight into the why behind the surprising things readers do with a text, we will draw on the psychology of reading, where socially constructed memory networks, cognitive schemas, and meta-knowledge actively shape interpretation. User-testing to discover the representations readers are in fact creating can be critical for many kinds of writing, from informative websites, to persuasive arguments, or engaging accounts. Turning then to writers, we will examine the key processes, from interpreting the task, to planning, revision and metacognitive awareness on which expert and novice writers differ. You will also learn a set of process-tracing methods for tracking these problem-solving strategies as you do two case studies. One will uncover the (sometimes radical) differences in how a set of readers actually interpret (construct the meaning of) a text you choose. The second will be an extended case study of your own thinking process on a real task you are doing outside this class.  Here you are likely to uncover old unconscious habits and problems you had to solve, as well as successful strategies, which will give you new reflective insight into your own thinking as a writer.

This course introduces the challenges transnational feminism has posed to Western notions of feminism. To explore these contestations, we will look at a series of controversies. This course will take six case studies concerning cultural practices that have generated global debates about the status of women and issues like consent, freedom, and equality. Beginning with several works about regional/Islamic practices of veiling, we will look specifically at the close connections made between womens practices and elements of tradition, including religion.

That toolkit will include methods for the collection data, its processing via off-the-shelf software and some simple code, as well as its analysis using a variety of statistical techniques. In doing so, the class offers students in the humanities the opportunity to put their expertise in qualitative analysis into conversation with more quantitative approaches, and those from more technically-oriented fields the opportunity to gain experience with the possibilities and pitfalls of working with language.

This view of legal discourse is disputed by critics who point out the figurative aspects of legal language, the relevance of character, emotion, and narrative in legal communication, and the ways in which law protects social structures of power such as race, class, and gender privilege. The course broadly examines the fraught relationship between rhetoric and law by considering the ways in which a variety of legal discourses serve to construct and reinforce identities, with a particular focus on the ways in which legal systems are portrayed to reflect the ideals of democracy to suit particular foreign relations goals. We begin by studying the ways in which Cold War foreign policy goals influenced desegregation and civil rights discourse in the United States, then we turn to the ways in which the prosecutions of deposed authoritarian rulers in various regions of the globe have been orchestrated to persuade global audiences that emerging democracies observe the rule of law for purposes of garnering international support.

1136,"It is well-known that there is a gender wage gap in the United States: on average, a woman performing the exact same work as a male colleague will make 78-82 of his salary. What is less well-known is that a major factor contributing to this wage gap is that women are simply less likely to ask for a raise or negotiate for a high starting salary. However, the solution is not as simple as telling women to ask for raises: recent research also shows that (unlike men) when women do ask for more money, they are perceived as unlikeable and difficult. This course will look at how gender-based stereotypes affect how we perceive and respond to different communication acts. The exact same sentencespoken with the exact same body language and intonationcan often elicit different reactions depending on whether the speaker is a man or a woman. Such stereotypes harm and limit both men and women. Just as a woman asking for a raise may be perceived as pushy or difficult, a man trying to console a male friend is often perceived as weak and unlikeable. This course will identify some of these stereotypes and then look at research suggesting what steps we can take to minimize their impact. For instance, we will examine how companies can take steps to minimize gender bias in written employee performance evaluations. We will examine strategies women can use to ask for a raise without being perceived negatively. We will develop strategies for responding to biased language and perceptions.

And again, unlike traditional journalism, the point of view of the writer is not supposedly neutral. What makes this kind of non-fiction engaging often comes down to point of view. A writer is telling us a story they know well, either through observation or personal experience. Writers telling stories in this genre are opinionated, and often full of personality and voice. The obligation of the writer is to connect what might be merely personal to a wide audience, and usually, to connect whats personal to broader context, situating stories in the historical and political moment.",None,None,Literary Journalism Workshop,9.0,English,"Mccafferty, Jane",Graduate,76-760,9.0,4.67,5.0,4.67,5.0,4.67,4.67

In this course, we will ask how narratives work rhetorically to shape how we perceive and encounter events, movements, places, and experiences. Students can expect to read and discuss narrative theories and practice employing these theories to analyze story artifacts, such as written collections, political speeches, newspaper articles, curated experiences, and oral histories. We will begin the semester by exploring and analyzing the many stories surrounding September 11 but will also consider the stories that infuse recent or local subjects of interest. Students will investigate the effect these and other narratives have on contemporary contexts. Any student who is interested in developing a critical awareness of the rhetorical power of storytelling and enhancing their analytical toolkit will benefit from this course.  Most class sessions will involve guided student discussions of theoretical texts as well as collaborative opportunities to analyze story artifacts.

We study the structure of written texts  the semi-conscious rules people use to organize paragraphs, for example  as well as the unconscious rules that organize oral discourse such as spontaneous stories and arguments. We study how people signal their intended audience-interpretations of what they say as foreground or background information, a casual remark or solemn promise, more of the same or change of topic. We look at how grammar is influenced by what people need to do with language, and how discourse affects grammar over time. We ask how children and other language learners learn how to make things happen with talk and writing. We ask how people learn what language is for, from exchanging information to writing poetry to perpetuating systems of belief. We analyze the choices speakers and writers make that show how they see themselves and how they relate to others. (Choices about how to address other people, for example, both create and reflect relationships of power and solidarity).

It should not duplicate a course offered in the regular schedule of classes. A student wishing to take an independent study needs to locate a faculty member whose research interests are close to the area of proposed study and meet with the faculty member to discuss whether it is something the faculty member is interested in doing. The department requires that the student and instructor submit a written contract (available in the English Department) detailing the expectations (description of course of study, readings, how often the student/faculty member will meet) and requirements for the completed independent study project (number  length of papers) and a time-line for completion of the work.

While much of early scholarship on feminist rhetorics dedicated itself to recovering the voices of women in history, since then scholars have expanded their focus to consider how gender interacts with the concerns of protest, law, health, medicine, war, politics, technology, migration, and the list goes on. Throughout this course, we will consider how feminist rhetorical scholars have 1) critiqued the discipline of rhetoric; 2) developed new methods useful for analyzing gender in a variety of contexts; and 3) expanded the scenes of rhetorical study. Readings will include (but are not limited to) canonical investigations into early feminist rhetorics (Karlyn Kohrs Campbell, Cheryl Glenn, Jacqueline Jones Royster), influential theories on contemporary topics (Karma Chvez, Robin Jensen, Raka Shome), and popular accounts of feminism by current writers and activists (Beyonc, Roxane Gay, Malala Yousafzai).   Students will conduct their own research on a topic related to feminist rhetoric that also aligns with their professional and academic goals. Graduate students interested in research will benefit from this courses focus on theory and methodology and gain an understanding of the scholarly trajectory of feminist rhetoric.

1225,"Privacy is a complex and multi-faceted concept. This course combines technical, economic, legal, and policy perspectives to present a holistic view of its role and value in the digital age.  The reduction of the cost of storing and manipulating information has led organizations to capture increasing amounts of information about individual behavior. New trade-offs have emerged for parties involved with privacy-enhancing or intrusive technologies: individuals want to avoid the misuse of the information they pass along to others, but they also want to share enough information to achieve satisfactory interactions; organizations want to know more about the parties with whom they interact, but they do not want to alienate them with policies deemed as intrusive. Is there a sweet spot that satisfies the interests of all parties? Is there a combination of technological solutions, economic incentives, and legal safeguards that is acceptable for the individual and beneficial to society?

Its goals are: first, to familiarize students with ways that historians think about their research, how they carry it out, and how they debate findings with other historians; second, to train students in best practices for doing historical research in primary and secondary sources. We discuss how to ask questions about the past and develop a one-semester research topic, find appropriate primary and secondary sources, take notes from those sources, and write a paper that answers an original question using skills we have studied. In the Spring 2019 semester, we will use the topic of the history of witchcraft and witch-hunting to focus the class.  Although Western beliefs in witchcraft and devil worship dated back to antiquity, the 16th and 17th centuries witnessed the Great European Witch-Hunt, which cost the lives of thousands across Europe and in its American colonies. Ever since, historians have struggled to explain why fears of witchcraft suddenly became so acute in this period.  And although the witch-hunts in early modern Europe and its colonies gradually came to an end, beliefs in witchcraft persist into the modern era and, in many parts of the world today, continue to generate campaigns of popular violence against alleged perpetrators. In this course, well examine both primary historical sources and secondary scholarship to explore competing interpretations of this complex historical puzzle.

1285,"Invented in 1839, photography was a form of visual expression that immediately attracted a large public following. Starting around 1900, photography was practiced with two dominant strands. One of these firmly believed in the power of photographs to provide a window on the world, and was led by Lewis Hine, whose documentary photographs for the National Child Labor Committee helped to ameliorate living and working conditions for thousands of immigrant children. The other strand adhered to the philosophy of Alfred Stieglitz who adamantly affirmed that photographs were first and foremost reflections of the soul and were art objects, equal to painting, drawing and sculpture. These two schools of thought guided photographers throughout the twentieth century. This course explores in depth the tremendous range of photographic expression since World War II and examines in particular the contributions of significant image-makers such as Helen Levitt, W.

This class seeks to teach students how to address the entire machine learning pipeline, starting from messy data and provisional questions and ending with actionable interpretations and insights.  The course will cover discovery, planning, analysis, and interpretation. Discovery involves understanding the data at hand, determining what is and is not answerable, and question generation. Planning involves contrasting the application of the desired machine learning method on ideal clean data with the messy data at hand. Dealing with representation, missing data, and designing appropriate machine learning machinery are all involved in planning. Analysis involves applying the machine learning method, checking model performance and assumptions in a principled and responsible manner. Interpretation involves the transformation of algorthm outputs into meaningful and actionable characterizations of the results. Each part of the pipeline is interconnected and students will learn to anticipate and address limitations through understanding of the pipeline as a whole.  Throughout the course we will focus on one vertical, health care, recognizing that the methods developed will generalize to others. We will work with real, messy, structured and unstructed data--including databases, text, and images. We will contrast machine learning methods against what is currently used in health care analytics, and describe the advantages and promise of each.",95-791 or 17-401 or 10-601 or 95-828 or 17-601,None,Applied Analytics: the Machine Learning Pipeline,12.0,Information Systems:Sch of IS & Mgt,"Weiss, Jeremy",Graduate,95-845,11.6,3.9,3.7,3.8,4.8,3.7,3.7
1390,"Marketing has become much more quantitative and data intensive in recent years. Strategies like interactive marketing, customer relationship management, and database marketing push companies to utilize the information they collect about their customers in order to make better marketing decisions. Marketing transaction data-which is a common type of Big Data-often forms the core set of information used for making marketing decisions. This course focuses on how analytic techniques from data mining, machine learning and statistical modeling can be applied to solve marketing problems. The approach in this course is to complete a series of data intensive case studies which gives us a hands-on approach to learning marketing analytics.  Each case exposes students to the data, the marketing problem, and a compatible analytical technique.  Specifically, the case studies considered include pricing decision support systems using retail transaction data, understanding customer churn in the cell-phone market, upgrading freemium customers to paying customers, and lifetime cycles in direct marketing. On the analytical side we use regression, mixed models, logistic regression, decision trees, cluster analysis, and topic models.   This course is an intermediate level one, and is meant for those that have successfully completed the regression analysis course.

1391,"Product managers engage in a variety of complex activities critical to product success including: Product requirements gathering, Forecasting customer demand, Customer segmentation, Pricing, Allocating marketing spend, Identifying buying patterns, Analyzing and responding to customer feedback.  Historically decisions in these areas have often relied on intuition and guesswork, leading to misjudgment of the market and other key factors, and ultimately, product failures. Developments in data science, combining the increasing availability of data from internal and external sources with new algorithms that exploit that data at scale, offer new possibilities for putting product management decisions on a more quantitative and rigorous footing. This course is primarily aimed at students with technical backgrounds who wish to apply their skills to product management. Students in this course will be introduced to a variety of data science techniques applicable to activities to which product managers typically contribute. These techniques include preference modeling, time series forecasting, regression, clustering, classification, A/B testing, and analytics for unstructured data. Along the way, students will learn about practical aspects of applying data science to product management, including: Choosing appropriate metrics for product success, Selecting and assessing data sources, Data science infrastructure choices, Evaluating data science models, Documenting and communicating data science results, Planning and delivering data science projects, Data science pitfalls to watch for.",95-796,None,Making Products Count: Data Science for Product Managers,6.0,Information Systems:Sch of IS & Mgt,"Steier, David",Graduate,95-851,8.75,3.94,3.58,3.83,4.64,3.75,3.75

1394,"Many organizations need to analyze large amounts of data such as text, images, audio, and video to discover useful information. For example, a company may want to monitor how the public discusses its products in social media, or a forensics team may need to discover the contents of disk drives seized by law enforcement. A recurring issue is that we often do not know what structure is present in the data initially. This course provides students with an understanding of common and emerging methods of organizing, summarizing, and analyzing large collections of this unstructured data (unstructured data analytics). There is a heavy emphasis on hands-on programming experience. For students with very limited or no programming experience or who are after a more conceptual exposition, consider taking 94-775 instead.  Learning Objectives:  By the end of the course, students are expected to have developed the following skills. Skills are assessed by the homework assignments and the final exam.   * Recall and discuss common methods of conducting exploratory and predictive analysis of unstructured data;  * Write Python code for exploratory and predictive data analysis that handles large datasets; and  * Work with the Amazon AWS cloud computing platform; and * Apply unstructured data analysis techniques discussed in class to solve problems faced by governments and companies.

1395,"The ability to secure information within a modern enterprise is a growing challenge. Threats to information security are global, persistent, and increasingly sophisticated. Long gone are the days when managers could hope to secure the enterprise through ad hoc means.   Effective information security at the enterprise level requires participation, planning, and practice.  Fortunately, the information security community has developed a variety of resources, methods, and best practices to help modern enterprises address the challenge. However, employing these tools demands a high degree of commitment, understanding, and skill-attributes that must be sustained through constant awareness and training.  An essential part of the information security plan is cyber security policy - this includes the written plans for how the enterprise IT assets will be protected.   This course provides students with information on the origin of cyber security policy, governance structures for policy creation, selection and implementation of policy, and audit and control functions to ensure compliance and efficacy. Students will be exposed to the national and international policy and legal considerations related to cybersecurity and cyberspace such as privacy, intellectual property, cybercrime, homeland security (i.e., critical infrastructure protection) and cyberwarfare, and the organizations involved in the formulation of such policies.

In general, these courses are designed to give students some real research experience through work on a faculty project or lab in ways that might stimulate and nurture subsequent interest in research participation. Faculty and students devise a personal and regularized meeting and task schedule. Each Research Training course is worth 9 units, which generally means a minimum for students of about 9 work-hours per week. These courses are offered only as electives; i.e., they cannot be applied toward a college or major requirement, although the units do count toward graduation as elective units. Additional details (including a roster and descriptions of Research Training Courses available in any given semester) are available in the Academic Advisory Center. Prerequisites/ restrictions: for Dietrich College students only; only for second-semester freshmen, or first- or second-semester sophomores; minimum cumulative QPA of 3.0 (at the time of registration) required for approved entry; additional prerequisites (e.g., language proficiency) may arise out of the particular demands of the research project in question.",None,None,Research Training: Institute for Politics and Strategy,,Institute for Politics and Strategy,"Arana, Ignacio",Freshman,84-198,,,,,,,

In this course, we aim to learn about how political systems differ, discuss why they differ and explore the consequences of such variation. The course is divided into four sections. In the first part, we will examine the main theories and methods used to conduct research in the subfield, and discuss the development and consolidation of the modern state. In the second section, we will examine political regimes, including variation among democracies and nondemocracies. In the third unit, we will study some of the countries central political institutions. We will compare presidentialism to parliamentarism, and examine legislatures, electoral systems, and political parties. In the final segment, we will scrutinize political mobilization and conflict.

Rather, successful policy is the result of thorough research, careful drafting, and successful navigation within the government or non-government organization whose leadership may ultimately promulgate it.  The course begins with a brief review of government and organizational behavior in a bureaucracy, and the identification of a federal agencys current policy system as a framework to which we will turn throughout the term.  Study then turns to an overview of legal research skills.  Though usually the province of law students and attorneys, such skills will enable students to know when policy may be crafted from scratch -- or where, when, and how policy must conform to larger governing legal or regulatory structures.  Students will then consider a particular sub-specie of public policy, administrative law, which addresses the special circumstance of regulatory agencies and the statutory regimes that create and govern them.

During this second course, taken in the first mini of the junior year, students will select one of three areas on which to focus: spiritual, environmental and institutional or community health.   They will be asked to engage in a recursive, reflective process to assess their own level of wellness in this area, develop short-term goals for the next year and a statement of a longer-term goal in this area, identify possible resources and then choose activities that promote this aspect of wellness.  Students should expect to devote 9-14 hours to the development and articulation of their plan in order to earn a passing grade. These hours are tied to completion of the requested assessments and not to the activities students elect to pursue in fulfillment of their wellness plan.  This course is intended for juniors only.

These phases in the development of a Latin American cultural identity represent the existence of certain dominant discourses and controversies that are important in understanding Latin American culture (Larrain 1996). The idea is to explore how Latin America imagines itself and constructs a narrative about its origins and development. There are three main questions we will be exploring throughout the course: Where does the discussion about Latin America emerge from?; How does Latin America think of itself?; What does Latin America want to be?. These questions will be explored historically through readings of philosophical and political texts that deal with Latin American identity as well as with literary texts, films and music that represent practices that enact this/ese identity/ies.

Our exploration of U.S. Latino history and cultures will compare and contrast the experiences of people from the above-described categories and analyze the dynamic tension amongst them, with other minority groups, and with the mainstream US society.

In this course we will explore this idea in the realm of music through the creation of new technologies that will expand the possibilities of live performance. The technologies we develop will be used in a series of public concerts by CMUs Exploded Ensemble, a group of high-caliber musicians dedicated to electro-acoustic performance of avant-garde concert music. The course will work closely with the Exploded Ensemble to develop expansive technologies that will transform the music the group performs. These transformations may take place in many different modalities. In the realm of sound we will investigate several areas: the development of new software for sound processing and synthesis, the creation of new instruments, and experimental methods of sound amplification and distribution. In the visual realm, we will develop software for live video performance, will investigate experimental techniques for video projection including mapping and the use of depth cameras, and will develop tools for computer controlled lighting systems.

Among many important formal arrival points, which are the most important? In addition to these questions, we will also look at recent work on ways in which 18th-century musicians may have understood meter very differently from most musicians today. These alternate perspectives open new possibilities for hearing and shaping the flow of musical time in baroque and classical music. These issues will be pursued from two directions. We will develop simple theoretical tools that can make score analysis a helpful input to the decisions that performers make about such questions. We will also examine audio and video recordings by famous artists to see both how they dealt with these issues and what new questions are raised. Week-to-week work will include reading, listening, and score analysis. Students will write term papers that either use one of the main perspectives developed in class (starting from scores or starting from recordings) or else combine the two.

It is based on the principal that use affects functioning. By learning to be more aware of how they use themselves, students of the technique find they are able to make changes that allow them to perform daily tasks and activities with a new sense of freedom, balance, and support.  As a performing artist, you can use the Alexander Technique to help you prevent or manage common performance problems such as: stage fright, lack of poise or confidence, lack of breath control, vocal strain, and physical discomfort while practicing or performing.  The Alexander Technique offers relief from many physical problems that interfere with performing. This includes, but is not limited to, poor posture, headaches, jaw tension, and repetitive strain injuries.

Although they are often masked by overarching terms such as ?common-practice tonality,? the differences between Corelli and early Beethoven in terms of basic compositional practice ? that is, in terms of harmony, meter, and form ? represent a fundamental change in musical language.  In contrast, the differences between Mozart and Mahler simply represent different stages within a single evolutionary development.    Guided by readings from music theory and historical musicology, as well as by our own analyses of scores, this course will attempt to chart these developments across three musical styles that overlap both in time and in substance: the baroque, the galant, and the classical.  Focusing especially on composers from Bach to Mozart, the twin goals will be the ability to understand individual works in relation to their own style-historical moments, and an understanding of how musical style changed over the course of the century.

Often, these phrases are used without explicit specification of which entity is being referred to; to understand the phrase, the interpreter has to create an inferential bridge from the definite noun phrase to information already in the discourse.

The course takes these steps for both sentential and quantificational logic. Presentation: The material is presented on-line, though some exercises must be done with pen and paper.

2175,"Intonation is the melody of speech: how a speakers pitch changes over the course of an utterance, along with the placement of emphasis, or sentence-level stress.  Intonation and stress contribute to the interpretation of utterances in multiple ways. For example, the questions Did BOB go to the store? and Did Bob go to the STORE? contain the same words, but request different information. Similarly, whether the sentence Bob went to the store is interpreted as a statement or as a question, and whether as expressing certainty or uncertainty on the part of the speaker, depends on its intonation. Features of intonation can also convey information about the speakers attitudes and affect: sarcasm and irony, for example, may be signaled by intonation.   The goal of this course is two-fold. First, students will learn about the phonetic correlates of intonation and stress, and learn how to analyze intonation as a system of high and low tones, using the intonation transcription system ToBI.  This will enable students to accurately describe the intonation pattern of an utterance. Second, students will learn how intonation is used to convey semantic and pragmatic information. The course will focus primarily on English, but other languages will be explored to serve as a basis of comparison. There is no prerequisite, and no familiarity with either phonetics or semantics is assumed.

Is this likely to occur?  How will emerging technologies reshape the U.S. labor market?  What can policy makers do to ensure that the growth of the American economy is more inclusive and equitable?  The curriculum of 90-745 has been rewritten to help Heinz students (and other interested CMU students) think seriously and rigorously about the future of work in the 21st century American economy.  Drawing upon the most recent quantitative analyses, the course will show that technological change has contributed to increasingly unequal outcomes in the U.S. labor market for decades, and that this trend is likely to continue as a new wave of technological change unfolds.  The course will also consider the degree to which globalization, immigration, rising monopoly power, declining union strength, minimum wage laws, and discrimination based on race and gender have contributed to rising inequality in U.S. incomes.  The course will draw upon frontier research to identify old and new policy ideas that could help make economic growth more inclusive, and it will bring into the classroom policy entrepreneurs who are making a real difference.  Students will not just study the problems associated with the future of work - they will also get directly involved in the generation of meaningful solutions by completing original policy analyses for government agencies and nonprofits seeking to make that future more equitable.

Program evaluation is the systematic application of social science methods to assess each aspect of a program: the need for the program, the programs design and implementation, and ultimately the programs impact on relevant outcomes. A completed program evaluation results in (1) information regarding the programs merit, worth, or significance, (2) an accounting of the objective strengths and limitations of this information and (3) the implications of both (1) and (2) for decision making.  Program evaluations differ as much as the social programs they evaluate. Social programs may carry them out internally, or an external organization may be brought in. An evaluation may be highly quantitative or entirely qualitative; it may focus exclusively on needs assessment or assessing program implementation. Evaluations and their results may be highly politically charged or of interest only to direct stakeholders. There are excellent program evaluations that have had tremendous positive impacts on programs and their target populations. There are also poor or flawed program evaluations that provide weaker information than could have been obtained, provide incorrect information, or are misleading.

The resulting fiscal relationships have been controversial, with Washington spending trillions in grants and other assistance, but with conditions, or strings that state and local governments often find onerous and intrusive.  Furthermore, federal budget deficits are now forcing political leaders in Washington to find ways to curtail spending, with many assistance programs potentially on the chopping block and states left to enforce federal standards with less money. This seminar examines the decisions political leaders must make to pay for the public good.  Should highways, for example, be funded by users (through tolls), by vehicle owners (through a gasoline tax) or by all taxpayers (who benefit from highways even if they do not drive)?  Should the federal government be forcing states to implement federal standards, like raising the drinking age as a condition for receiving federal highway funds?  How will such developing technologies and behaviors as electric vehicles and ride sharing change the economics and politics of funding our transportation infrastructure?  How can the federal government balance the budget without shortchanging vital national priorities? The seminar will focus on the tough choices policymakers face over taxation and spending at all levels of government through case studies that illustrate the issues.  Students will develop briefing papers and lead class discussions that explore how federal, state and local interests can align or collide depending on the issue.   The seminar encourages students to improve their decision making experience over complex issues of politics and government finance, and skillsets at analyzing and explaining policy issues in a debate setting.",None,None,Financing the Public Good,6.0,Public Policy & Mgt:Sch of Pub Pol & Mgt,"Krumbhaar, George",Graduate,90-788,6.8,4.7,4.2,4.4,4.8,4.6,4.3

2384,"Date:  March 30 and April 6 In the Pittsburgh region, communities just a few miles outside of the Golden Triangle are still grappling with the impact of the decline of the steel industry in the 1980s.  How will emerging technologies address the challenges of these communities?  This micro course would explore the potential consequences of Smart City technology, specifically autonomous and electric vehicles, on the outlying areas of the Pittsburgh region, with a particular focus on McKeesport and nearby municipalities that make up the Steel Valley or Mon Valley.      Students will be exposed to the history of disruption in these steel communities and their particular challenges.  Using a base understanding of the technological developments in automation (e.g. autonomous and electric vehicles), advanced communications (e.g. 5G wireless), and the sharing economy (e.g. Uber, Lyft), theyll attempt to project potential consequences that could unfold for these communities, with specific emphasis on land use, economic vibrancy, and workforce preparation.  Based on their projection, students will be required to propose interventions that could enhance opportunities or mitigate negative impacts of the technology as its adoption unfolds.  This a real world public policy challenge for community leaders and municipal, county, and state government policy makers.  The analysis and recommendations generated will be shared with them.  Technological change and the disruption it brings frequently outpaces the ability of society and policy makers to respond.

This micro class is a two-day dive into the future of K-12 education, a 600 billion industry in the U.S. affecting the lives of over 55 million children every year. The class focuses on the intersection of education and technology, and its implications for the future of how we teach, learn, and live. Students will learn about the promise of personalization, a big idea with the potential to change the management model that has organized schooling for more than a century. Theyll be exposed to research and reform efforts, including some happening here at CMU, to apply technology and cognitive learning to improve how we teach and learn, and to anticipate ways technology could facilitate new ways of organizing the experience of school. Then theyll unpack these ideas to identify future scenarios, their implications, and anticipate how the benefits and costs would likely be distributed. Participants will identify actions that could be taken to improve the potential effect on the human condition, mitigating the risks and maximizing the benefits across many stakeholders, including those who have been historically marginalized and disadvantaged. As part of the experience, students will be challenged to apply the skills they are learning in their courses, and will experience facilitation techniques they are likely to find useful in their own careers, whatever field they ultimately pursue.

2386,The past decade has seen the increasing availability of very large scale   data sets arising from the rapid growth of transformative technologies   such as the Internet and cellular telephones along with the development   of new and powerful computational methods to analyze such datasets.  Such   methods developed in the closely related fields of machine learning data   mining and artificial intelligence provide a powerful set of tools for   intelligent problem-solving and data-driven policy analysis.  These   methods have the potential to dramatically improve the public welfare by   guiding policy decisions and interventions and their incorporation into   intelligent information systems will improve public services in domains   ranging from medicine and public health to law enforcement and security.    This course will provide a basic introduction to large scale data analysis   methods focusing on three main problem paradigms (prediction modeling   and detection).  Students will learn how to translate policy questions   into these paradigms choose and apply the appropriate artificial   intelligence and machine learning tools and correctly interpret   evaluate and apply the results for policy analysis and decision making.   We will emphasize tools that can scale up to real-world policy problems   involving reasoning in complex and uncertain environments discovering new   and useful patterns and drawing inferences from large amounts of   structured high-dimensional and multivariate data.

2490,"An introduction to programming based on a functional model of computation.  The functional model is a natural generalization of algebra in which programs are formulas that describe the output of a computation in terms of its inputs---that is, as a function.  But instead of being confined to real- or complex-valued functions, the functional model extends the algebraic view to a very rich class of data types, including not only aggregates built up from other types, but also functions themselves as values.  This course is an introduction to programming that is focused on the central concepts of function and type.  One major theme is the interplay between inductive types, which are built up incrementally; recursive functions, which compute over inductive types by decomposition; and proof by structural induction, which is used to prove the correctness and time complexity of a recursive function.  Another major theme is the role of types in structuring large programs into separate modules, and the integration of imperative programming through the introduction of data types whose values may be altered during computation.    NOTE: students must achieve a C or better in order to use   this course to satisfy the pre-requisite for any subsequent Computer   Science course.",(15-151 or 21-127 or 21-128) and (15-112),None,Principles of Functional Programming,10.0,SCS: Computer Science,"Erdmann, Michael",Freshman,15-150,11.2,4.52,4.04,4.5,4.72,4.4,4.26

The  course introduces the foundational concepts and fundamental techniques  of the most prominent and successful approaches to programming language  semantics that have been developed. Broadly speaking, semantics is  concerned with the provision of mathematical meanings to programs, at an  appropriate level of abstraction, to allow formalization of program  behavior and facilitate proofs of correctness. Our aim is to demonstrate  the utility of a scientific approach to programming and languages. We  focus on the most important and most general frameworks for semantic  description: denotational and operational semantics. These frameworks  are widely applicable and offer complementary approaches to language  definition, with various advantages. We also discuss formal  specifications, and logics of program correctness. We make extensive use  of mathematical and structural induction, and computational induction.  We use semantics to describe program behavior, guide the development of  correct programs, specify and prove the correctness of a compiler,  validate program logics, and derive laws of program equivalence.

The course aims to cover the techniques used today in software that does useful things with text in human languages like English and Chinese. Applications of NLP include automatic translation between languages, extraction and summarization of information in documents, question answering and dialog systems, and conversational agents. This course will focus on core representations and algorithms, with some time spent on real-world applications. Because modern NLP relies so heavily on Machine Learning, well cover the basics of discrete classification and probabilistic modeling as we go. Good computational linguists also know about Linguistics, so topics in linguistics (phonology, morphology, and syntax) will be covered when fitting. From a software engineering perspective, there will be an emphasis on rapid prototyping, a useful skill in many other areas of Computer Science. In particular, we will introduce some high-level languages (e.g., regular expressions and Dyna) and some scripting languages (e.g., Python and Perl) that can greatly simplify prototype implementation.",15-122,None,Natural Language Processing,12.0,SCS: Language Technologies Institute,"Black, Alan",Senior,11-411,7.195,3.035,2.84,3.09,3.655,2.875,2.375

2703,"Massively Multi-player Online Role-Playing Games have evolved into Virtual Worlds (VWs), and are creating ever richer environments for experimentation on all aspects of human to human, or human to machine communication, as well as for information discovery and access. So far, interaction has been constrained by the limited capabilities of keyboards, joysticks, or computer mice. This creates an exciting opportunity for explorative research on speech input and output, speech-to-speech translation, or any aspect of language technology. Of particular interest will be a combination with other novel real world (RW) input, or output devices, such as mobile phones or portable games consoles, because they can be used to control the VW, or make it accessible everywhere in RW. Language technologies in particular profit from context awareness, because domain adaptation can be performed. For scientific experimentation in that area, Virtual Worlds offer the opportunity to concentrate on algorithms, because context sensors can be written with a few lines of code, without the need for extra hardware sensors. Algorithms can also run continuously, without the need for specific data collection times or places, because the VW is always on.    In this lab, we will enhance existing clients to virtual worlds so that they can connect to various speech and language related research systems developed at LTI and CMUs Silicon Valley campus. The lab will be held jointly at the CMUs Pittsburgh and Silicon Valley Campuses.

In turn, humans have also evolved complex mechanisms for receiving these signals and inferring the thoughts, feelings, and intentions of others. Proper understanding of human behavior, in all its nuance, requires careful consideration and integration of verbal, vocal, and visual information. These communication dynamics have long been studied in psychology and other social sciences. More recently, the field of multimodal affective computing has sought to enhance these studies using techniques from computer science and artificial intelligence. Common topics of study in this field include affective states, cognitive states, personality, psychopathology, social processes, and communication. As such, multimodal affective computing has broad applicability in both scientific and applied settings ranging from medicine and education to robotics and marketing.

The concepts begin with how to identify a new idea to for a business that can be effectively started.  Initial ideas often start as a grandiose plan to change the world and these plans are legitimately the fuel that drive new businesses forward.  However, when a company starts (e.g., builds a prototype or writes a  first line of code), what is the least product a company can produce that customers still want and need?  This kernel -- extracted from the big plan-- is a Minimal Viable Product (MVP).   Once an MVP business kernel is formulated, we will learn and study how to understand customer needs, how to market a new idea and how raise and manage money for a new business entity.

It should be of interest to anyone wishing to see the  way statistical ideas play out within the brain sciences, and it  will provide a series of case studies on the role of stochastic  models in scientific investigation.  Statistical ideas have been part of neurophysiology and the brainsciences since the first stochastic description of spike trains, and the quantal hypothesis of neurotransmitter release, more than 50 years ago. Many contemporary theories of neural system behavior are built  with statistical models. For example, integrate-and-fire neurons are  usually assumed to be driven in part by stochastic noise; the role of  spike timing involves the distinction between Poisson and non-Poisson  neurons; and oscillations are characterized by decomposing variation  into frequency-based components.  In the visual system, V1 simple  cells are often described using linear-nonlinear Poisson models; in  the motor system, neural response may involve direction tuning; and  CA1 hippocampal receptive field plasticity has been characterized  using dynamic place models.  It has also been proposed that  perceptions, decisions, and actions result from optimal (Bayesian)  combination of sensory input with previously-learned regularities; and  some investigators report new insights from viewing whole-brain  pattern responses as analogous to statistical classifiers.  Throughout the field of statistics, models incorporating random ``noise components are used as an effective vehicle for data analysis. In neuroscience, however, the models also help form a conceptual framework for understanding neural function.

Each of these two courses serves as a standalone as an introduction to entrepreneurship, and the courses also provide a background for those seeking an entrepreneurship concentration or an in-depth Track immersion.  45805 emphasizes developing an understanding of entrepreneurial thought, mindset, and action, and then progresses thru idea generation, and screening for patterns to predict success, and which underlie entrepreneurial decision making for enterprise creation and growth. The focus is on identification of recognizing the difference between an idea and an opportunity first. Then we progress on how to develop a competitive advantage and a sustainable business model that creates, captures, and delivers value to the market.  High-growth ventures include tech-based ventures, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) with high growth potential, typically ranging from 20 to 50 annually (not lifestyle ventures).

Students will gain a perspective of various current theories and models of innovation, how innovations are brought to the market and positioned for successful launch and subsequent growth.  Students study and discuss both successful and unsuccessful attempts to bring innovations to the market via a series of lectures, readings, and case discussions.

It is the result of intense understanding of the SET factors (social, economic, and technology) and industry dynamics into which the opportunity will be introduced.  It is strategic because of rapid changes in the marketplace and the competitive-set which the opportunity must confront for execution in the emerging marketplace (emergent strategy or agile approach).

The model is employed to show how central banking shapes equilibrium in the banking system and how banking and central banking help determine employment, output, inflation, and financial market equilibrium beyond the banking system. Bank lending, interest on bank loans, the M2 money stock, and the interbank interest rate are explored in terms of the model.  A stylized history of financial intermediation explains the coexistence of banking, bond finance, and equity finance. The fundamental fragility of money and banking is explained via its evolution and the origins of the financial crisis of 2007-09. We see why higher minimum equity capital requirements for banks are the best regulatory means of maintaining a healthy and stable financial system.  We identify the intended and unintended consequences for banking stability of central bank last resort lending. Actual Federal Reserve monetary and credit policies in the financial crisis are evaluated using the model. Finally, the model is employed to show how quantitative easing (QE) at the zero interest bound works in the banking system, and to see why the payment of interest on bank reserve balances at the central bank will play a central role in the exit from the zero interest bound.",None,None,"Money, Banking & Financial Markets",6.0,Tepper School of Business,"Goodfriend, Marvin",Graduate,45-810,,,,,,,

Determining the price of a product or service is one of the most important marketing decisions. It is also one of the most complex and least understood aspects of marketing. While many marketing activities are geared toward creating value for the customer, sound pricing decisions are the fundamental tool for businesses to capture the value they create. In todays hypercompetitive environment, even slight errors in determining the best price can lead to large financial losses. This course draws on the fundamental disciplines of microeconomics, statistics and psychology to shed light on good pricing practice. It surveys some popular pricing practices, explores their pitfalls, and identifies the fallacies they are based on. The first part of the course discusses the foundations for sound pricing decisions: costs, customer and competition. It then moves on to current pricing strategies, tactics and their applications: pricing over the product life cycle; product line pricing; pricing through the marketing channel; price discrimination; two-part tariffs and nonlinear pricing; price bundling; perceived value pricing; and competitive pricing.

However, facilities are not necessarily connected in a serial fashion, despite its name. Therefore, a supply chain really describes a network of interconnected value-add transformations.  Supply chain management (SCM) is the coordination of production, inventory, location, and transportation among the participants in a supply chain to achieve the best mix of responsiveness and efficiency for the market being served (Hugos, 2011).  SCM includes the strategic design of this network, the tactical planning of supply, production, inventory, transportation, and distribution as well as the operational control of the flows of materials, information, money and physical goods.  Traditionally, the goal of SCM has been to maximize profitability or minimize cost.  Typically, this is achieved by matching supply and demand. Increasingly, the concept of risk, arising from uncertainty, disruptions, and need for rapid reaction, have also brought on the need to incorporate agility and responsiveness in the mix of goals.

Communication Tools and 6) all stages in the Seven Stages to Executive Presence.  The participants identify their individual challenges in personal business communications,  confront those challenges head-on.      This class work involves working on diverse monologues and/or duet scenes or improvisations -- as preferred by each participant.  Provided monologues are:  Assertive; Reflective; Extreme or Out There; Comic;  Shakespeare/Verse monologues.  At least one of a participants chosen monologues must be from the Comic Monologues category   as those monologues make overt demands on the participants perspective on the material, timing and reading an audience.  These choices can inform and positively impact work on choices from other categories.  In addition, the participants may also bring in dramatic materials that they have found elsewhere   subject to my approval, or a short presentation, if that might more directly addresses an identified goal.  Videotaping of performances could be involved   but only if desired by the individual participant; any video would be handed to each participant at the end of taping for their private viewing only.    This second course moves beyond introduction to practical mastery of acting techniques in communication.

2943,"This elective focuses on best practices in written communication for business people in managerial positions. Students will receive instruction and feedback to help them understand the expectations of future and present employers and Tepper faculty to: target decision-making audiences at all company levels with precise, problem-solving language; write effective email that encourages results; create short reports that make a work process transparent; develop a direct style that conveys an authoritative and reader-friendly tone; create charts and graphs that are precise and clear at a glance; use simple design/layout strategies that make a document more action-oriented; increase vocabulary/language awareness; and practice revision strategies.    Students will complete weekly written assignments of varying lengths (some in class).  These assignments fall into two options that each student will choose:  1) short assignments assigned by the professor (some involving short cases) or 2) one larger project of the students choosing.  Students will be guided in their choices since this course is open to part-time (usually already employed) students and full-time students (who will be preparing for either internships or full-time work).  In other words, students will be choosing the kinds of assignments that will best prepare them for their present and future work.

This course focuses on how analytic techniques from data mining, machine learning and statistical modeling can be applied to solve marketing problems.  The approach in this course is to complete a series of data intensive case studies which gives us a hands-on approach to learning marketing analytics.  Each case exposes students to the data, the marketing problem, and a compatible analytical technique.  Specifically, the case studies considered include pricing decision support systems using retail transaction data, understanding customer churn in the cell-phone market, upgrading freemium customers to paying customers, and lifetime cycles in direct marketing.

A major premise of the course is that star performers are made, not born. The difficulty is that workers often do not know how to achieve star performance. Many believe that it results primarily from innate talents or political game playing. Or, they engage in a trial-and-error approach that frequently leads to disappointing productivity results and undermines their self-esteem. In contrast, this course will focus on the work strategies and behaviors that star performers use to distinguish themselves. Students will learn what they need to do for their own development and, if time permits, what they can do to help develop subordinates/co-workers. ** NOTE: This is an experimental course bringing field based research to the classroom. It is a work in progress, building upon previous versions taught at Tepper. To the instructors knowledge, no course like it exists in any MBA program.

In addition, the course also discusses potential issues and challenges that are encountered when implementing the outcome of an operations research project in practice.  The course extends known optimization modeling concepts such as variables, objectives and constraints with more abstract modeling concepts such as index sets and parameters, which are indispensable when formulating large-scale optimization models. Furthermore, the course describes how operations research projects can benefit from multiple models that interact to solve the problem.  These (and other) topics are combined with hands-on experience with a professional modeling system.  The course will include a project to be done in small groups as well as weekly programming assignments.  At the end of this course, you will have learned how large-scale optimization problems (involving hundreds or thousands of variables and constraints) can be solved using a professional optimization system.

2960,"Real options analysis is an approach to the management of operational assets that exploits managerial flexibility in decision making and strives to combine it with market-driven valuation of cash flows.  This approach assumes that managers use all the available information when making decisions.  It is thus particularly useful when managing projects that involve dynamic and state-contingent choices among alternatives (options), especially of a strategic nature.  Examples include investing in and developing new products or technology, expanding/reducing manufacturing capacity, and suspending/resuming production. The valuation of financial options is the conceptual basis of real options management (but this course does not assume prior knowledge of this topic).  Real options analysis extends this fundamental market-driven valuation approach to a much broader spectrum of business applications that feature dynamic decision making.  It thus contrasts the standard net present value rule used by static discounted cash flow analysis.  The resulting managerial decisions and asset valuations can be very different when real options analysis is used rather than static discounted cash flow analysis. A unique feature of this course is blending market-based valuation and decision making concepts and techniques within business analytics.  This course thus includes essential content for students seeking managerial and consulting careers in a wide range of industries and settings.

We will examine the market failure Bitcoin was intended to resolve as well as the role of cryptography and distributed systems in enabling this new technology to create societal value. The course will go on to discuss the boundaries of the role of cryptography in blockchain. Next, we will use these tools to evaluate existing, real-world blockchain use cases with an eye towards developing our own applications of these emerging technologies.

2999,"This is an applied econometrics course that covers the estimation techniques and econometric theory used in contemporary empirical work. With the goal of making causal inference, we will focus on the application of the tools in corporate finance and accounting. The methods covered are applicable to all fields that use non-experimental data, while the emphasis will be on the application of tools rather than the statistical theory.   The course has three goals. Students will (i) learn the why and how of major econometric techniques, (ii) work with data to replicate major empirical results, and (iii) strengthen their ability to dissect, digest and critique academic research through referee reports. The topics include the standard empirical identification problem, sample selection and instrumental variables, difference-in-difference methods, natural experiments, event study and panel data methods.",None,None,Empirical Methods for Finance & Accounting,6.0,Tepper School of Business,"Karolyi, Stephen",Graduate,47-720,,,,,,,

It will cover basic topics such as the regulatory environment and BASEL accords; risk measures including value-at-risk and shortfall risk and approximations for these risk measures; coherent risk measures; and extreme value distributions leading to the generalized Pareto distribution. Simulation methods will be developed to efficiently calculate the risk associated with a portfolio of derivative securities, a portfolio of defaultable bonds, and nested simulations needed to perform stress tests or assess risk over longer time periods. The course will also address important aspects of credit risk including the pricing of credit derivatives such as CDS and CDO, counterparty credit risk and Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA).

3001,"Finance is the allocation of resources across states and time.  We will start with allocation across states - that is a static, single period model.  Allocation of resources across states is risk.   What is it?  We look at arbitrage and its implications, preferences over risky outcomes, portfolio choice, and equilibrium.  Surprisingly (or not) all these topics are tightly related.  Next up we look at the dynamic models.  The topics are the same.  We now just incorporate the new dimension of time along with states.  Here we look at dynamic arbitrage, dynamic preferences, and dynamic portfolio choice.  Lastly we look at equilibrium asset returns.  Here we explore some of the classic issues in finance about the dynamics of equity returns (the equity premium, for example).",None,None,Seminar in Finance I (Finance Theory),6.0,Tepper School of Business,"Routledge, Bryan",Graduate,47-721,,,,,,,

3003,"Bayesian methods are widely recognized for the unified approach that they offer to statistical analysis. Additionally, these methods are readily amenable to decision problems which are frequently found in Marketing problems. The growth of Bayesian methods in the last ten years is largely due to a new class of computational methods to solve previously intractable problems. These methods rely upon simulation techniques, particularly the use of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). These new techniques have allowed applied researchers and practitioners to focus more on solving new problems instead of the methodology. This has opened up new areas applied research to Bayesian methods. The focus of this course is applications of Bayesian statistical analysis to one of these areas, Marketing. We begin with a discussion of the Bayesian approach and follow this with the general linear model with special emphasis on hierarchical models.
