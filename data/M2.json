Because the course is based upon empirical research about professional academic writers, students will learn expert practices for authoring their own arguments that contribute to an existing community of authors. Because reading and writing are inseparable practices for academic writing, students will read a variety of texts so that they can explore and critically evaluate a single issue from multiple perspectives and from different disciplinary genres. Students will learn methods for summarizing, synthesizing, and analyzing arguments within that issue so that they may contribute an argument of their own.  The course is also geared toward helping students understand the requirements of advanced college-level writing. Our students are typically very accomplished readers and writers, and we are eager to push their accomplishments toward greater excellence. For this purpose, students will build upon their composing knowledge by reflecting and thinking strategically as they plan, write, and revise their own texts. Ultimately, they will develop critical reading, rhetorical and linguistic practices for analyzing and producing texts within the context of an academic community.  Each section of 76-101 is structured by the same objectives and core assignments. There is a core vocabulary and set of heuristics that all sections teach. However, students may find particular issues more appealing than others-we encourage students to pursue their interests, but we also ask that students engage any 76-101 course with intellectual curiosity.
