The examination comprises written and/or oral parts. The student will be considered to have passed the qualifying examination when he or she has successfully completed all of the required parts. A candidate must take the qualifying examination at the time specified by the department, generally within the first three semesters of study. Upon satisfactorily passing the examination, the student will be accepted as a candidate for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy.

Passing the Ph.D. qualifying examination admits a student to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree for a period of no longer than six calendar years. If, at the end of this six-year period, the Ph.D. has not been awarded, the student must reapply for admission to the graduate program and will be judged competitively with other students applying at the same time. If the student is re-admitted, he or she may, at the discretion of the department, be requested to pass the qualifying examination again before the Ph.D. is awarded.

Because the course is based upon empirical research about professional academic writers, students will learn expert practices for authoring their own arguments that contribute to an existing community of authors. Because reading and writing are inseparable practices for academic writing, students will read a variety of texts so that they can explore and critically evaluate a single issue from multiple perspectives and from different disciplinary genres. Students will learn methods for summarizing, synthesizing, and analyzing arguments within that issue so that they may contribute an argument of their own.  The course is also geared toward helping students understand the requirements of advanced college-level writing. Our students are typically very accomplished readers and writers, and we are eager to push their accomplishments toward greater excellence. For this purpose, students will build upon their composing knowledge by reflecting and thinking strategically as they plan, write, and revise their own texts. Ultimately, they will develop critical reading, rhetorical and linguistic practices for analyzing and producing texts within the context of an academic community.

Paralleling advances in hardware, there have been many advances in software: programming paradigms (imperative, object-oriented, functional, concurrent), development methodologies (CMM, agile), and algorithms for solving a range of problems (e.g., systems, networking, AI, machine learning, analytics). Starting around the late 1960s to the explosion of the Web in the early 90s the third disruptive age was in communicationthe ability for computer systems around the world to transmit, and share data. The combined advances in hardware, software, and communication forms the basis of our current disruptive age of Data. Massive amounts of data (Tera bytes and beyond) are available in a range of domains: science, commerce, finance, healthcare, social media, real-time sensors etc. At historically unprecedented levels we are able to collect, transmit, curate, and process huge amounts of data at enormous speeds resulting in our ability to do ongoing tasks better and to do tasks we couldnt do before.

They need to inherently support scalability, typically having high reliability and availability demands as well.

In this domain engineers not only need to know how to architect systems that are inherently scalable, but to do so in a way that also supports high availability, reliability, and performance.   Given the large distributed nature of these systems basic distributed systems concepts such as consistency and time and synchronization are also important.  These systems largely operate around the clock, placing an emphasis on operational concerns.

Methodological topics will include basic exploratory data analysis, elementary probability, hypothesis tests, and empirical research methods.  There is no calculus or programming requirement.  There will be one weekly computer lab for additional hands-on practice using an interactive software platform that allows student-driven inquiry.
