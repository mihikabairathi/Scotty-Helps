# Scotty-Helps: HackCMU 2019 Project!

## Inspiration
Planning semester schedules and going through the long course catalogs to find interesting courses has always been a pain, so we decided to make the process more fun and interesting

## What it does
If you enter your criteria, like the department you're looking at, the number of units, the type of course (core v/s elective), then we can filter out courses and rank them based on FCEs like hours spent in a week, teaching quality, and so on.

## How we built it
We used Python (pandas, beautifulsoup) to scrape the data and modify it from a scotty-labs course API. We used javascript with HTML and CSS for the front-end, using Flask as the server.

## Challenges we ran into
Front-end was a very new concept to us, and we had no idea how requests and servers even worked. Working with javascript was definitely the biggest difficulty. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of being able to learn new languages and concepts to create a cohesive application

## What we learned
We learnt a lot of new concepts like data scraping, wrangling, and deployment, but also sleeping.

## What's next for Scotty Helps
We're going to try to improve the user-interface to make it more dynamic and interesting for the user.
